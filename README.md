## Utsav's README
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Utsav Kesharwani. I work as an Engineering Manager for [Apollo.io](https://apollo.io/). I'm based out of Mumbai, India.

- Before joining Apollo.io, in the last decade, I'd the opportunity to work in a few super awesome orgs like:
  - [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) (providing browser as a service)
  - [QuantInsti](https://www.quantinsti.com/) (creating an ecosystem of Products for Algo Trading) 
  - [BookMyShow](https://in.bookmyshow.com/) (India's #1 ticket booking platform)

- And in these cool orgs, had a chance to work with amazing folks, expert mentors to carry out some of the high-scale planning and execution oriented projects like [Migrating BookMyShow's infra from on-prem to Cloud](https://medium.com/p/2e05d820ad2c).

- ðŸ‘€ My approach to solving complex problems is approaching incrementally, re-iterate, keep moving the business forward and eventually create the cleanest solution. After all, [what's the only way to eat an elephant?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindfully-present-fully-alive/201804/the-only-way-eat-elephant)

## My communication style
- I appreciate for honest, direct & polite conversations instead of the sugar-coated ones.

- This is how I prefer to communicate and expect the same in return.

- One of my previous managers adviced me, "when in doubt, just pick-up the damn phone and speak :smile:". In case of confusion, overcommunicate. This is something that just helps!

- ðŸ“« You can buzz me on Slack, or email me at utsav@apollo.io. Let's just do a quick Huddle or Meet or Zoom whenever needed (as per mutual timezone availability).

- Please don't ever hesitate to schedule a tea/coffee chat, brainstorming session, or anything else with me.

## My aspirations
- As a techy, I'm passionate about creating solutions that solve problem(s). And enjoy being in the company of ambitious folks who have the same zeal.

- As a manager, I'm awed by the concept of becoming a [servant leader](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/the-art-of-servant-leadership.aspx), and that's where I aim to improve.

- As an individual (and as a investor in stocks), I believe the power of compounding, and hence follow the mantra of [Atomic Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_nzqnXWvSo) to become better day-by-day.

- As a friend and buddy, love chatting on anything. I try to listen keenly and you'll have my undisturbed attention.
